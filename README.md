Ghana Health Service Data Analysis
Power BI Project
 I built this project using Power BI. I downloaded the data from the official website of Ghana Health Service from (2020 - 2024). The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of healthcare trends in Ghana, showing disease distribution, facility load, and regional differences. I noticed these two key points, the high staff-to-patient ratio suggests potential resource constraints, while the spike in deaths towards the end of the year warrants further investigation.
